# dsh-plugin-dev

A stable vocabulary and architectural decision skill for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) and Cordis — written for coding agents and the people who collaborate with them.

It establishes the canonical DSH/Cordis Context and a requirement-to-seam Decision Tree. Version-specific API catalogs, Slot inventories, and community implementation surveys are intentionally excluded: verify those details against the current DSH official documentation and source when implementing.

MIT licensed — use it, fork it, ship it.

## Install

```sh
npx skills add BotHarness/dsh-skill
```

Or copy `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.zh.md`, and `references/` into `.agents/skills/dsh-plugin-dev/`.

## What's inside

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `SKILL.md` | Foundation-first workflow and the skill's deliberate scope boundary |
| `SKILL.zh.md` | Chinese counterpart with canonical English identifiers preserved |
| `references/context.md` | Canonical vocabulary, native/application-defined boundaries, and concept maps |
| `references/decision-tree.md` | Requirement-to-seam decisions for dispatch, persistence, execution, and presentation |

Each reference has a maintained `.zh.md` counterpart. Historical implementation research remains only in the canonical BotHarness repository under `docs/research/`; it is not mirrored into the installed skill.

## Provenance

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `skillVersion` | 0.3.4 |
| `verifiedAgainst` | DSH 0.1.6-alpha.2 |
| `upstreamSha` | `ddefc45fbc7f8e46dd73185e68295696d1297887` (2026-09-17) |
| `verifiedAt` | 2026-09-20 |
| Sources | Pinned DSH evidence under `docs/research/`; DSH/Cordis foundations under `dsh_research/` in [BotHarness/BotHarness](https://github.com/BotHarness/BotHarness) |

DSH is in developer preview. Treat the Context and Decision Tree as stable design guidance, then check the current upstream release before relying on a concrete mechanism.

## Maintenance

The standalone repository is generated from `BotHarness/BotHarness` (`.agents/skills/dsh-plugin-dev/`) by `pnpm sync:skill`; do not hand-edit the mirror.
